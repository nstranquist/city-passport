City Passport Project:

profile:
- name
- age
- city

categories:
- coffee[],
- food (breakfast/lunch/dinner/other),
- music
- attractions

- Stamp View to display stamp object

stamp object: {
- id: unique id (npm uuid)
- name: string, name of venue
- category: string, one of the 4 categories, can change and move accross
- date: timestamp (javascript Date() api)
}

State:
    Array of arrays, each array is an array of objects

No redux, just using local state.
I could use hooks or this.state
hooks

TODO: add svg-url-loader for svgs

Fun future idea:
add a map of a city, add places you can go to to stamp this passport.
It will check against your profile data to tell you if you can or can't go there,
maybe even give a certain stamp limit for places, or give rewards for going to certain places and getting stamped there
