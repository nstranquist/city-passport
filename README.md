# City Passport Project

### Summary:
1) Enter your name, age, and city  
2) Collect 'stamps' in the different pages of your city passport  
3) Stamp categories include Coffee, Food, Music, and Attractions  

### Objectives:
- Practice state management with hooks, using a more complex pattern  
- This pattern is an Array of Objects, each describing another array of objects  
- Looks like: Categories[] -> {...data, stamps[]} -> stamps[{...stamp}]  

### Screens:
- Home View: see favorites, other 'shortcut summary' items  
- Profile View: Update and Observe profile information  
- Categories View: See all passport categories (aka "pages")  
- Category Detail View: See all details / stamps for selected Category  

### Desired Features:
- Favorite a category  
- Add stamps  
- Update profile
- Include a map (future feature)  
- ...more to come
